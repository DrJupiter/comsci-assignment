    "_Exercise: Creating Word Shifts_\n",
    ">    1. Pick a day of your choice in 2020. We call it $d$. It is more interesting if you pick a day where you expect something relevant to occur (e.g. Christmas, New Year, Corona starting, the market crashes...).\n",
    ">    2. Build two lists $l$ and $l_{ref}$ containing all tokens for submissions posted on r/wallstreebets on day $d$, and in the 7 days preceding day $d$, respectively. \n",
    ">    3. For each token $i$, compute the relative frequency in the two lists $l$ and $l_{ref}$. We call them $p(i,l)$ and $p(i,l_{ref})$, respectively. The relative frequency is computed as the number of times a token occurs over the total length of the document. Store the result in a dictionary.\n",
    ">    4. For each token $i$, compute the difference in relative frequency $\\delta p(i) = p(i,l) - p(i,l_{ref})$. Store the values in a dictionary. Print the top 10 tokens (those with largest relative frequency). Do you notice anything interesting?\n",
    ">    5. Now, for each token, compute the happiness $h(i) = labMT(i) - 5$, using the labMT dictionary. Here, we subtract $5$, so that positive tokens will have a positive value and negative tokens will have a negative value. Then, compute the product $\\delta \\Phi = h(i)\\cdot \\delta p(i)$. Store the results in a dictionary. \n",
    ">    6. Print the top 10 tokens, ordered by the absolute value of $|\\delta \\Phi|$. Explain in your own words the meaning of $\\delta \\Phi$. If that is unclear, have a look at [this page](https://shifterator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cookbook/weighted_avg_shifts.html).\n",
    ">    7. Now install the [``shifterator``](https://shifterator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html) Python package. We will use it for plotting Word Shifts. \n",
    ">    8. Use the function ``shifterator.WeightedAvgShift`` to plot the WordShift, showing which words contributed the most to make your day of choice _d_ happier or more sad then days in the preceding 7 days. Comment on the figure. \n",
    ">    9. How do words that you printed in step 6 relate to those shown by the WordShift? "
